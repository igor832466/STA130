    "\n",
    "\"On average, what impact does meaninful, in-person interaction between individuals have on a person's self-reported life satisfaction?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables I plan to explore are those that...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. quantify the actual amount of in-person interactions that took place between individuals\n",
    "    \n",
    ">    This is the first primary predictor variable. I am using the amount of interactions to see if they have any impact on participants' self-reported life satisfaction. I am specifically focusing on in-person interactions as they have been shown to have a greater impact on mental health (Stieger et al., 2023), and thus overall life satisfcation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. describe/quantify the \"desired\" amount of in-person interaction individuals want\n",
    "\n",
    ">   This is the second primary predictor variable, which I will combine with the first variable to create the \"amount of desired and actual in-person interactions\". This variable helps examines if people who receive a \"desired\" amount of in-person interactions have a higher life satisfaction than those who either receive more than, or less than their desired amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. quantify a person's self-reported life satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    ">    This is the primary outcome variable. I plan on analyzing this kind of variable since looking at people's life self-reported life satisfaction can show to what extend in-person interactions make a person feel they are enjoying their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. describe barriers to in-person interactions\n",
    "\n",
    ">    This is a confounding variable. Analyzing these barriers can show that, while people would enjoy in-person interactions, they are not able to for some reasons. This can help explain how rather than not benefiting from in-person interactions, some people are simply not able to have these interactions in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visuals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A histogram of each varaible/group of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is useful to get a sense of the data being analyzed for each variable. For example, creating a histogram of all participants' self-reported life satisfaction helps in seeing the overll distribution which is helpful when analyzing and comparing this variable to other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A bar plot for comparisons of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> Creating a bar plot for a comparison (such as amount of desired and actual in-person interactions versus life satisfaction) can help to show underlying relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A scatter plot of the predictor and outcome variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> A scatter plot can also help understand the how the predictor variable \"predicts\" the outcome, which helps with both analysis and ultimately formulating a conclusion.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, I will remove first count the amount of missing values to determine if I can then remove participants' responses that do not cover all variable types. If I cannot, I will change the amount of variables I will analyze. If I can, I will remove those responses in order to continue with my analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bootstrapping variables and combinations of variables (such as amount of desired and actual in-person interactions versus life satisfaction) can help to make the sample better represent the Canadian population. I am planning on using the sample mean to estimate the population mean to answer my research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the predictor varaible can predict the outcome variable, creating a theoretical linear regression model can display this relationship and account for the sources of the error term (the confounding variables). This step can also help determine if the predictor and outcome varaibles are related at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All data collected from participants is correct\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Participants had a clear understanding of themselves, their mental their physical health, and their situation when answering questions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Participants understood the questions in the survey clearly and were able to answer them accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
