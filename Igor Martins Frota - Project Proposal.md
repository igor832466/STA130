## 1. Research Question

"On average, what impact does meaninful, in-person interaction between individuals have on a person's self-reported life satisfaction?"

----

## 2. Variables and Visuals


### Variables

Variables I plan to explore are those that...

1. quantify the actual amount of in-person interactions that took place between individuals
    
>    This is the first primary predictor variable. I am using the amount of interactions to see if they have any impact on participants' self-reported life satisfaction. I am specifically focusing on in-person interactions as they have been shown to have a greater impact on mental health (Stieger et al., 2023), and thus overall life satisfcation. 

2. describe/quantify the "desired" amount of in-person interaction individuals want

>   This is the second primary predictor variable, which I will combine with the first variable to create the "amount of desired and actual in-person interactions". This variable helps examines if people who receive a "desired" amount of in-person interactions have a higher life satisfaction than those who either receive more than, or less than their desired amount.

3. quantify a person's self-reported life satisfaction

>    This is the primary outcome variable. I plan on analyzing this kind of variable since looking at people's life self-reported life satisfaction can show to what extend in-person interactions make a person feel they are enjoying their life.

4. describe barriers to in-person interactions

>    This is a confounding variable. Analyzing these barriers can show that, while people would enjoy in-person interactions, they are not able to for some reasons. This can help explain how rather than not benefiting from in-person interactions, some people are simply not able to have these interactions in the first place.

### Visuals

1. A histogram of each varaible/group of variables

> This is useful to get a sense of the data being analyzed for each variable. For example, creating a histogram of all participants' self-reported life satisfaction helps in seeing the overll distribution which is helpful when analyzing and comparing this variable to other variables. 

2. A bar plot for comparisons of variables

> Creating a bar plot for a comparison (such as amount of desired and actual in-person interactions versus life satisfaction) can help to show underlying relationships between variables.

3. A scatter plot of the predictor and outcome variables

> A scatter plot can also help understand the how the predictor variable "predicts" the outcome, which helps with both analysis and ultimately formulating a conclusion.

----

## 3. Methodology and Assumptions

### Methodology

Steps:

1. Data Organization

> Here, I will remove first count the amount of missing values to determine if I can then remove participants' responses that do not cover all variable types. If I cannot, I will change the amount of variables I will analyze. If I can, I will remove those responses in order to continue with my analysis.

2. Bootstrapping

> Bootstrapping variables and combinations of variables (such as amount of desired and actual in-person interactions versus life satisfaction) can help to make the sample better represent the Canadian population. I am planning on using the sample mean to estimate the population mean to answer my research question.

3. Simple Linear Regression

> If the predictor varaible can predict the outcome variable, creating a theoretical linear regression model can display this relationship and account for the sources of the error term (the confounding variables). This step can also help determine if the predictor and outcome varaibles are related at all.

### Assumptions

1. All data collected from participants is correct

2. Participants had a clear understanding of themselves, their mental their physical health, and their situation when answering questions

3. Participants understood the questions in the survey clearly and were able to answer them accordingly

----

## 4. Hypothesis

Participants who receive their desired amount of in-person human interaction have, on average, a life satisfaction score of over 5.

## 1. Research Question
> "Does serious, long-term romantic relationships have an impact on mental health"
----

## 2. Variables and Visuals

### Variables

1. DEMO_relationship_status

> This is the predictor variable. I am choosing this variable as I want to research and compare relationship status to happies. 

2. WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health

> This is the outcome variable. I choose this variable in particular as it describes participants' mental health and not a more arbitrary measure such as happiness. Doing so helps in the analysis process, as it makes the data less subjective as overall happiness is not clearly defined compared to the state of an individual's mental health.

### Visuals

1. A histogram of each varaible/group of variables

> This is useful to get a sense of the data being analyzed for each variable. For example, creating a histogram of all participants' happiness score helps in seeing the overll distribution which is helpful when analyzing and comparing this variable to other variables. 

2. A bar plot for comparisons of variables

> Creating a bar plot for a comparison (such as relationship status versus happiness score) can help to show underlying relationships between variables.

3. A scatter plot of the predictor and outcome variables

> A scatter plot can also help understand the how the predictor variable "predicts" the outcome, which helps with both analysis and ultimately formulating a conclusion.

2. Bootstrapping

>Bootstrapping the sample means of a control group and test group can help with the analysis. The control group is participants not in a serious, long-term romantic relationship, while the test group is participants in a serious, long-term romantic relationship

3. Compare

>Once the previous steps are completed, I will compare the bootstrapped sample mean of both the test group with the control group. If the bootstrapped sample mean of the control group is higher than, or equal to, the test group, then relationships have either a negative impact or no impact on an individual's mental health. However, if the bootstrapped sample mean of the test group is higher than the control group, then relationships do indeed have an impact on mental health.

### Assumptions

1. All data collected from participants is correct.

2. Participants had a clear understanding of themselves, their mental their physical health, and their situation when answering questions.

3. Participants understood the questions in the survey clearly and were able to answer them accordingly.

## 4. Hypothesis

Being in a long-term, serious romantic relationship benefits the individual's mental health.

# <center>Analysis 3</center>

## 1. Research Question
> On average, are people diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) more likely to experience loneliness than those who are not diagnosed?
----
## 2. Variables and Visuals

1. WELLNESS_anxiety_diagnosis

>This is the predictor variable. I am specifically selecting people with a GAD diagnosis as there is medical proof participants have this condition.

2. LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated

>This is the outcome variable. Anxiety and loneliness are known to be linked; individuals diagnosed with GAD may also suffer from isolation due to their condition (Brown et al., 2021).

3. WELLNESS_anxiety_treatment

>This is a confounding variable. Taking this into account is important, as people who are being treated for GAD may experience less loneliness due to their GAD.

4. WELLNESS_anxiety_limited/WELLNESS_anxiety_restriction

>This is a cunfounding variable. Both variables are variations of the same variable but for different version of the same survey. Understanding how anxiety impacts an individual's activities, and hence add to their isolation, is important to understand and explore. Doing so can help those diagnosed with GAD through this project and its goal.

5. LONELY_lifecourse_

>This is a confounding variable. Loneliness and anxiety may impact different age groups differently. Exploring this may produce interesting and helpful results for those impacted. 

### Visuals

1. A histogram of each varaible/group of variables

> This is useful to get a sense of the data being analyzed for each variable. For example, creating a histogram of all participants' loneliness score helps in seeing the overll distribution which is helpful when analyzing and comparing this variable to other variables. 

2. A bar plot for comparisons of variables

> Creating a bar plot for a comparison (such as anxiety diagnosis versus loneliness score) can help to show underlying relationships between variables.

3. A scatter plot of the predictor and outcome variables

> A scatter plot can also help understand the how the predictor variable "predicts" the outcome, which helps with both analysis and ultimately formulating a conclusion.

2. Participants had a clear understanding of themselves, their mental their physical health, and their situation when answering questions.

3. Participants understood the questions in the survey clearly and were able to answer them accordingly.

4. While many individuals who suffer from GAD do not have a diagnosis, this analysis assumes the following:
>
    >a. All participants with a GAD diagnosis do indeed suffer from GAD.
    >
    >b. All participants without a GAD diagnosis do not suffer from GAD.
>

5. For this analysis, the terms isolation and loneliness are used interchangeably.
----

## 4. Hypothesis

Participants diagnosed with GAD are, on average, more likely to experience loneliness than those who are not diagnosed.
