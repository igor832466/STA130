    "\n",

    "1. **First Code Block**: \n",
    "   - Implements a **first-order Markov chain**, where the chatbot predicts the next word based on the current word. It tracks how many times each word is used and how frequently each word follows another word.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Second Code Block**: \n",
    "   - Extends this to a **second-order Markov chain** that uses pairs of consecutive words (bigrams) to predict the next word, with an additional focus on **character-specific dialogue**. It tracks how often characters use certain word pairs and which words follow those pairs.\n",
    "   - The second block uses `avatar.character`, but it wasn't clear how this connected to the first block or the tokenized `words` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing Part**:\n",
    "   - The likely missing piece is a **bigrams generation step**. To connect the first block (single-word transitions) with the second block (bigram transitions), you would need to preprocess the `words` list to create bigrams.\n",
    "   - I suggested a method for generating bigrams and incorporating them into the second block, allowing it to work as a second-order Markov chain.\n",
