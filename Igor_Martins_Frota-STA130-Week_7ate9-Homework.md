**Components of the theoretical Simple Linear Regression**

The theoretical Simple Linear Regression model describes how the dependent and independent variable are related. It does so by using a line (called the theoretical model or theoretical regression line) to estimate the relationship seen in a scatterplot of the data: 

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$

| Variable | Represents... |
|:-:|:-:|
| $Y_1$ | the **outcome** (what is trying to be predicted) |
| $\beta_0$ | the **intercept coefficient** (the y-intercept of the line)  |
| $\beta_1$ | the **slope coefficient** (slope of the theoretical model) (see below) |
| $x_i$ | the **predictor** (what is being used for the prediction) |
| $\epsilon_i$ | the **error term** (see below) |

$\beta_1$ explanation:

> if $\beta_1$ > 0, as $x_i$ increases, $Y_1$ increases

> if $\beta_1$ < 0, as $x_i$ increases, $Y_1$ decreases

> if $\beta_1$ = 0, no relation between $x_i$ and $Y_1$

$\epsilon_i$ explanation:

> As the theoretical model is a "line of best fit", there will most likely be some vertical distance between a data point and the theoretical model. The error term is that observed vertical distance.

Mathematical explanation for the error term:

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \quad \epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$

This states that the error term is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. In other words, error terms within the standard deviation are more likely than those outside the standard deviation following a normal distribution.

**How the components combine to form a sample from normal distribution**

A sample is formed by first creating the theoretical model using the outcome, predictor, intercept coefficient, and slope variables and applying them to the data. At this point, the y-values of all data points should be equal to the y-value of the theoretical model at the data points' x-values. Afterwards, each data point is vertically shifted up or down by its error term. Because the error term is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0, the shift of each data point will also follow this distribution (with shift within the error term's standard deviation being more likely than those outside it). In other words, for each predictor variable, the outcome variable is normally distributed since the error term is also normally distributed.


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42) 

n = 100

hours_of_study = np.random.uniform(low=1, high=10, size=n)  


beta_0 = 50
beta_1 = 5
sigma = 10

error_term = norm.rvs(loc=0, scale=sigma, size=n)

exam_score = beta_0 + beta_1 * hours_of_study + error_term

##### Part 1
<details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>View</u></summary>

>##### Session Summary: Understanding the Normal Distribution in Simple Linear Regression
>
>This session focused on understanding how the components of the **theoretical simple linear regression model** lead to the outcome variable being normally distributed.  The discussion began with an initial explanation that needed some clarification.  Through a collaborative process, the explanation was refined to accurately describe the data generation process in simple linear regression.
>
>##### Initial Explanation and Areas for Improvement
>
>The initial explanation correctly identified the role of the normally distributed **error term** but did not clearly distinguish between the **theoretical model** and the **fitted model**. The order of operations in data generation was also not fully explained.
>
>##### Revised Explanation: Key Points and Strengths
>
>The revised explanation was significantly improved and demonstrated a solid understanding of the key concepts. It included the following strengths:
>
>*   **Clear distinction between theoretical and fitted models:** The revised explanation correctly started with the theoretical model and described it using the equation:
>
>    $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$
>
>*   **Accurate data generation process:** The steps involved in generating data according to the theoretical simple linear regression model were outlined:
    1.  **Predictor values** ($x_i$) are determined.
    2.  **Random errors** ($\epsilon_i$) are generated from a normal distribution ($N(0, \sigma)$).
    3.  **Outcome values** ($Y_i$) are calculated using the simple linear regression equation.
>
>*   **Emphasis on the normal distribution of errors:** The explanation highlighted that the error term is assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of Ïƒ. This assumption is fundamental to the model.
>
>*   **Clear statement of the conclusion:** The explanation correctly concluded that because the errors are normally distributed, the outcome variable ($Y_i$) is also normally distributed for each specific value of the predictor variable.
>
>##### Additional Insights and Connections to the Sources
>
>The discussion also highlighted several important insights from the sources that enhance understanding of simple linear regression and the normal distribution:
>
>*   **Simulation:** The sources emphasize the use of **simulation** to illustrate the data generation process and visualize the normal distribution of the outcome variable. 
>*   **Homoscedasticity:** For the outcome variable to be normally distributed for each predictor value, the **variance of the errors** needs to be **constant** (homoscedasticity).
>*   **Assumptions of simple linear regression:**  The validity of the model and the inferences drawn from it rely on several key **assumptions**, including: normality of errors, homoscedasticity, linearity, independence of errors, and no measurement error in the predictor variable. 
>*   **Model diagnostics:** In practice, **model diagnostics** are used to assess whether these assumptions are met by the observed data. 
>
>##### Conclusion
>
>The session successfully clarified the relationship between the components of the theoretical simple linear regression model and the normal distribution of the outcome variable. It reinforced the importance of the assumptions underlying the model and introduced the concepts of simulation and model diagnostics. These insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of simple linear regression as presented in the sources.
>
>While the sources provided valuable information on these topics, they do not explicitly cover model diagnostics in detail.  Further exploration of this topic may require consulting additional resources.

##### Part 2

<details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>View</u></summary>

>##### Session Summary: Exploring Scatter Plots and Random Seeds
>
>This conversation focused on understanding two key concepts related to data visualization and analysis:
>
>*   **Scatter Plots with Multiple Y Values for the Same X Value:**  It was clarified that scatter plots can indeed have multiple y values corresponding to the same x value. This is a common occurrence in real-world data, reflecting variability and the influence of other factors on the relationship between variables. Techniques like jittering and transparency can help visualize overlapping points, though this is not explicitly discussed in the sources. The importance of model fitting in capturing overall trends despite data variability is also emphasized. 
>
>*   **The Role of a Random Seed (`np.random.seed(42)`)**: The conversation explored the purpose of setting a random seed in Python using `np.random.seed(42)`. This line of code initializes NumPy's random number generator to a specific starting point (42 in this case), ensuring that the same sequence of "random" numbers is generated every time the code is run. The sources repeatedly stress the importance of **reproducibility** in data analysis. Setting a seed allows researchers to recreate their analyses, verify findings, and build upon existing work.
>
>    *   While the specific value of 42 is arbitrary, the principle of using a consistent seed value is crucial for reproducibility. 
    *   The impact of `np.random.seed(42)` is not directly visible in the scatter plot generated from the code, but it guarantees that the underlying simulated data remains the same each time the code is executed. 
    *   This ensures consistent statistical properties, such as correlation, slope, and R-squared values, enabling meaningful comparisons and replication of results.
>
>**The sources and conversation highlight the importance of simulation in statistics to study sampling distributions and statistical processes. Setting a random seed ensures consistency in these simulations and supports the exploration of key statistical concepts.**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import pandas as pd

# generating the hours_of_study and exam_score

np.random.seed(42) 

n = 100

# what do each of the following provide?
fitted_model.summary()  # provides details (of the fitted_model) such as its coefficients, R-squared value, standard errors, and p-values
fitted_model.summary().tables[1]  # because .summary() creates a table, .tables[1] retrieves the information in the 1st index of the table. This information is the coefficient (both the intercept and slope coefficients), standard error, t-value, p-value, and the confidence interval

# what two things does this add onto the figure?
df['Data'] = 'Data' # hack to add data to legend # adds a legend called 'Data'
fig = px.scatter(df, x='x',  y='Y', color='Data', # the first thing it adds is a scatter plot of the data in df

The difference is that the fitted model is a trendline that fits the data set and estimates the relationship between the predictor and outcome variables. By comparison, the theoretical model is a line that outlines the "true" relationship between both variables since it includes an error term. This term accounts for random variation errors; factors not captured by the predictor variable but that impact the outcome variable nonetheless. 

As such, while both display how the predictor variable relates to the outcome variable, the fitted model estimates the relationship based on data. The theoretical model does the same; however, it accounts for an error term, thus displaying the "true" relationship between both varaibles.

With simulation of random samples, because the fitted model fits the data, it changes with each new dataset. However, the theoretical model remains constant throughtout the process as it does not depend on the data.

>### Summary of Our Session: Understanding the Error Term in Simple Linear Regression
>
>Our conversation focused on the role of simulating random samples variation in linear regression and the meaning of the error term's random variation.
>
>*   You initially asked how simulating random samples variation connects with linear regression. The response highlighted the close relationship between these concepts, emphasizing how simulation helps understand the **error term** in linear regression models.
>
>    *   The response explained that the **error term ($\epsilon_i$) in the simple linear regression model ($Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$) represents the random variation** in the outcome variable ($Y_i$) that is not explained by the linear relationship with the predictor variable ($x_i$). 
>    *   It was noted that simulating random samples with different errors helps visualize the impact of the error term on the estimated regression coefficients, illustrating the **uncertainty associated with these estimates**.
>    *   **Bootstrapping**, a resampling technique, was mentioned as a method to estimate the variability of regression coefficients and other model statistics in linear regression. The response described how bootstrapping involves repeatedly resampling from the original dataset, fitting linear regression models to each bootstrap sample, and using the distribution of the fitted coefficients to estimate their **sampling distribution** and calculate **confidence intervals**.
>    *   The discussion also touched upon the use of simulation in **hypothesis testing for linear regression**. It outlined the process of simulating datasets under the null hypothesis of no linear association (i.e., the slope coefficient $\beta_1$ is equal to 0). By comparing the observed slope coefficient from the original data to the distribution of simulated slope coefficients, a **p-value can be calculated to assess the statistical significance of the observed relationship**.
>*   Your follow-up question asked for clarification on the meaning of the error term's random variation in simple linear regression. The response provided a detailed explanation of this concept, emphasizing the key characteristics and assumptions related to the error term:
>
>    *   The response reiterated the **equation of the simple linear regression model ($Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$)** and explained that the error term represents the random variation that the predictor variable doesn't explain.
>    *   It was noted that the sources use the terms **error**, **noise**, and **random variable** interchangeably with $\epsilon_i$.
>    *   The response highlighted that the error term is typically assumed to be **normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$**. This assumption implies that the errors are randomly scattered around the regression line. The response explained that this assumption can be incorporated into simulations by generating random errors from a normal distribution and then using the regression equation to calculate the corresponding outcome values. 
>    *   **Homoscedasticity**, the assumption that the variance of the errors is constant across all values of the predictor variable, was also discussed. The response pointed out that violating this assumption (i.e., having **heteroscedastic errors**) can impact the accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients.
>    *   Another crucial assumption highlighted was the **independence of errors**, meaning that the value of one error term does not depend on the values of other error terms. The response emphasized that violating this assumption (e.g., having correlated errors) can lead to biased estimates.
>    *   The response explained that **unbiased errors** are assumed to have an average value of 0 for any given value of the predictor variable, which can be expressed as $E[\epsilon_i] = 0$.
>    *   The discussion then explored the **impact of the error term's variance on model accuracy**. A large variance indicates that the model may not fit the data well, suggesting other factors influence the outcome variable. Conversely, a small variance suggests a good model fit, implying the predictor variable explains much of the outcome variable's variation.
>    *   **R-squared (coefficient of determination)** was introduced as a measure of the proportion of the total variation in the outcome variable explained by the linear regression model. The response provided the formula for calculating R-squared and explained how to interpret its value. For instance, an R-squared of 0.7 suggests that 70% of the outcome variable's variation is explained by the model, with the remaining 30% attributed to random variation and other unaccounted factors.
>    *   Finally, the response clarified that, in practice, **we don't directly observe the true error terms ($\epsilon_i$).** Instead, we work with **residuals ($e_i$ or $\hat \epsilon_i$)**, which are the differences between the observed outcome values ($Y_i$) and the fitted values from the model ($\hat y_i$). Residuals help assess the validity of the linear regression model's assumptions.

``fitted_model.fittedvalues`` is derived by creating the fitted Simple Linear Regression model, $\hat{y}_i = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_i$ and replacing $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ with the values given by ``fitted_model.summary().tables[1]``/`fitted_model.params`/`fitted_model.params.values`. Each value of the predictor variable is then used to calculate its corresponding outcome variable value, and once this process is complete, the results are displayed in `fitted_model.fittedvalues`.

The line chosen for the fitted model is the `trendline='ols'`. 

Residuals are the vertical distances between data points and the fitted regression line. Squaring residuals ensures that positive and negative residuals do not, for example, result in a sum close to zero. Additionally, squaring is also helpful as it emphasizes larger residuals, allowing outliers to have a larger impact on the fitted line and thus make it account for more extreme data points. 

As such, using the OLS method therefore finds the line with the intercept and slope coefficients that minimize the sum of sqaured residuals, thus fitting the data best.

>Finally, you asked for a concise explanation of the line chosen for the fitted model using OLS. The response provided a clear and concise explanation, emphasizing that OLS aims to find the line with intercept and slope coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared residuals. It also reiterated the reasons for **squaring the residuals**: to avoid canceling out positive and negative residuals and to emphasize larger errors.

The first expression is the formula for the R-squared. It can be interpreted as the "proportion of variation in Y explained by the model" since it divides the sum of squared residuals by the total sum of squares (measure of the total variability in the outcome variable around its mean). This results in the proportion of total variation that is not explained by the model. Thus, subtracting this ratio by 1 gives the proportion of total variation that is explained by the model (the R-squared value). An R-squared value of 0 means that 0% of the variation in the outcome variable can be explained by the model, while an R-sqaured value of 1 means 100%. 

`fitted_model.rsqaured` calculates the R-squared value.

`np.corrcoef(Y,fitted_model.fittedvalues)[0,1]**2` calculates the correlation coefficient between the outcome variable value (`Y`) and the fitted model (`fitted_model.fittedvalues`) at the given correlation matrix index of [0,1]. Squaring the correlation coefficient results in effectively calculating the R-squared value. Therefore, this expression calculates how well the fitted values explain the outcome variable values (i.e., the goodness of fit of the fitted model).

`np.corrcoef(Y,x)[0,1]**2` does the same calculation as the expression above. However, instead of using the fitted values, it directly uses the predictor variable. Therefore, this expression calculates the correlation between the predictor and outcome variables, and sqauring this correlation results in the R-squared value.

#### Assumptions and Contradictions:

1. Linearity

The graph on the left does not appear to show a linear relationship between the outcome and predictor variables, but rather a quadratic relationship.

2. Normally Distributed Errors/Residuals

The residuals of a fitted linear regression model are assumed to be normally distributed. However, as seen from the graph on the right, the residuals of this model are not normally distributed.

3. Homoscedasticity

As the graph on the left displays a non-random scattering of residuals, the model is not homoscedastic.

4. Unbiased Errors/Residuals

According to the graph on the right, the mean of the distribution of residuals is not 0. As a result, the residuals are biased.

##### Summary Part 2

<details class="details-example"><summary style="color:blue"><u>View</u></summary>

### A Discussion on the Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression

This session focused on clarifying the assumptions of **normally distributed residuals** and **homoscedasticity** in the context of **Simple Linear Regression** models. The conversation explored the distinctions between these two concepts and how they are related, ultimately emphasizing their importance in ensuring the validity and reliability of regression analyses.

#### Understanding the Assumptions

*   **Normally Distributed Residuals:** This assumption, rooted in the theoretical model specification, states that the **error terms** ($\epsilon_i$) are normally distributed. Residuals ($\text{e}_i$ or  $\hat{\epsilon}_i$), which are calculated from the fitted model, serve as proxies for the unobservable error terms. Therefore, we evaluate this assumption by examining the distribution of the residuals, using tools like histograms, Q-Q plots, and formal statistical tests.
*   **Homoscedasticity:** This assumption requires the variance of the error terms to remain constant across all values of the predictor variable ($x_i$).  It ensures that the spread of data points around the regression line is consistent, implying consistent predictability of the outcome variable for all predictor values. Residual plots, specifically residuals versus fitted values, are used to visually assess homoscedasticity. Patterns like funnel shapes or curved patterns can indicate violations (heteroscedasticity).

#### The Importance of the Assumptions

The sources and the conversation highlight that both **normality** and **homoscedasticity** are critical for the following reasons:

*   **Valid Inference:** The reliability of statistical tests, p-values, and confidence intervals, which are used to make inferences about the relationship between variables, relies on the fulfillment of these assumptions.
*   **Efficient Estimation:** Violations, particularly heteroscedasticity, can lead to inefficient estimates of the regression coefficients, meaning their variances are larger than necessary.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** The sources repeatedly emphasize the ethical responsibility of researchers to assess these assumptions. Ignoring potential violations can produce misleading results, impacting the integrity of the analysis.

#### The Distinction Between Errors and Residuals

The conversation clarified a common point of confusion regarding the assumption of normality. While we assume **error terms** to be normally distributed, we can only assess this assumption indirectly by examining the distribution of the **residuals** from the fitted model. This distinction is crucial for conceptual clarity and accurate interpretation of the results.

#### The Interplay Between the Assumptions

While distinct, **normality** and **homoscedasticity** are interconnected. Heteroscedasticity, in some cases, can influence the shape of the residual distribution, making it appear non-normal even if the underlying error terms are normally distributed.

#### Addressing Violations

If heteroscedasticity is identified, several approaches can be taken to mitigate its impact, as discussed in the conversation. These include data transformations, weighted least squares regression (WLS), and the use of robust standard errors.

#### Concluding Remarks

The session emphasized the importance of **residual analysis** as a critical step in any Simple Linear Regression analysis. It provides a means to evaluate both the normality of residuals and the homoscedasticity assumption, ensuring that the regression model is appropriate and the results are reliable.

#### Null hypothesis:
>$H_0$: $\beta_1$ = 0
>
>Since $\beta_1$ quantifies the average rate of change, it is the population parameter relevant to the prompt. 

#### According to the code....

$p$-value

>the p-value for this null hypothesis is 0.000. This means that there is no evidence in favour of the null hypothesis, and it can thus be rejected.

Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$

> the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ does not include $\beta_1$ = 0. As such, there is a 95% confidence that $\beta_1$ does not have a value of 0.

$t$-statistic

> the t-statistic is 34.089. Larger t-statistics indicate storng evidence against the null hypothesis.

As such, considering the p-value, confidence interval, and t-statistic, the null hypothesis can be reject due to the large amount of evidence against it. In the context of the Old Faithful Geyser, there is strong evidence that there is a linear association between the predictor and outcome variable. In other words, the amount of time spent waiting for an eruption is predictive of the duration of the next eruption

>### Summary of Our Session: Exploring Simple Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing
>
>This session focused on the fundamental concepts of simple linear regression, particularly the model parameters, the formulation and testing of hypotheses, and the importance of the assumptions underlying this statistical approach.
>
>We began by examining the **parameters** that constitute the simple linear regression model. The sources consistently emphasize that the **slope coefficient** ($\beta_1$) plays a pivotal role in quantifying the linear association between the predictor and outcome variables.  The **intercept** ($\beta_0$), while important, often has limited interpretive value in practice.  We also discussed the **error term** ($\epsilon_i$), which represents the random variation in the outcome not explained by the linear relationship. The assumptions about the error term, namely **normality**, **homoscedasticity**, **linearity**, and **independence**, are crucial for the validity and reliability of the regression analysis.
>
>Our conversation then turned to **hypothesis testing**, specifically the formulation of a null hypothesis of "no linear regression" on average.  The sources highlight that this null hypothesis, formally stated as  $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, asserts that there is no systematic linear relationship between the variables in the population. We discussed several methods for testing this hypothesis, including using the **p-value** from the regression output, **simulation-based approaches**, and **bootstrapped confidence intervals**. The consistent theme is the evaluation of the evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to conclusions about the presence or absence of a linear association.
>
>Our earlier discussion about **normally distributed residuals** and **homoscedasticity** directly connected to the assumptions surrounding the error term.

>### Session Summary: Exploring the Nuances of  $\beta_1$ and P-values in Simple Linear Regression
>
>This conversation focused on understanding two key concepts in the context of simple linear regression: the slope coefficient, $\beta_1$, and the interpretation of p-values, particularly a p-value of 0.000. The sources provided valuable background information on hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the distinction between population parameters and sample statistics, which enriched the discussion. 
>
>#### Key Insights from the Session:
>
>*   **$\beta_1$ as a Population Parameter:**  $\beta_1$ represents the true, underlying linear relationship between the predictor and outcome variables across the entire population. The conversation emphasized that it's a population parameter because it reflects a characteristic of the entire population, a value we aim to estimate from sample data. The sources draw a clear distinction between the theoretical regression model with population parameters and the fitted model based on observed sample data. 
>*   **Estimating $\beta_1$:** Since accessing the whole population is usually impractical, we use sample data and methods like ordinary least squares to estimate  $\beta_1$. The estimated slope, $\hat{\beta}_1$, derived from the sample, is our best guess for the population parameter $\beta_1$. The sources and the conversation underscored that statistics from a sample are used to estimate population parameters. 
>*   **Inference and Uncertainty:** Statistical inference helps us assess the uncertainty associated with our estimate of $\beta_1$ and draw conclusions about the population parameter. This involves techniques like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.  
>    *   **Hypothesis testing** involves formulating null hypotheses, such as $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, which posits no linear association. The sample data is then evaluated to see if it supports or contradicts this null hypothesis. 
>    *   **Confidence intervals** provide a range of plausible values for $\beta_1$ based on the sample estimate. 
>*   **Interpreting a P-value of 0.000:** A p-value of 0.000, while suggesting the null hypothesis is highly implausible, does **not** constitute definitive proof. Instead, it represents **extremely strong evidence against the null hypothesis**. The conversation clarified that p-values are evidence-based assessments, not absolute proofs.
>*   **Practical Considerations:** It's important to consider practical factors like rounding errors in statistical software or limitations in simulations that might lead to a p-value of 0.000 when the true probability is very small but not actually zero.
>*   **Appropriate Language:** Instead of claiming a null hypothesis is "impossible," it's more accurate to state that it's been **rejected** based on the evidence. Rejecting a null hypothesis means there is enough evidence to doubt its validity, not that it's been proven false.
>
>#### Applying to the Old Faithful Geyser Dataset:
>
>In the Old Faithful Geyser dataset, $\beta_1$ represents the true average change in eruption duration for every additional minute of waiting time. $\hat{\beta}_1$, calculated from the sample data, would be our estimate. A p-value of 0.000 for $\hat{\beta}_1$ would strongly suggest rejecting the null hypothesis of no linear association, indicating a likely linear relationship between waiting time and eruption duration.
>
>#### Conclusion:
>
>The session clarified the nature of $\beta_1$ as a population parameter and the importance of cautious interpretation of p-values, particularly when they are extremely small. The conversation, informed by the sources, emphasized the role of statistical inference in drawing conclusions from data and the need to consider practical limitations in p-value calculations.

##### According to the code....

$p$-value

>the p-value for the null hypothesis is 0.238. As $p$ > 0.1, there is no evidence against the null hypothesis.

Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$

> the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ includes $\beta_1$ = 0. As such, there is a 95% confidence that $\beta_1$ has a value of 0, which is further evidence which fail to reject a null hypothesis of $\beta_1$ = 0.

$t$-statistic

> the t-statistic is 1.188. A small t-statistic such as this indicates that a $\beta_1$ coefficient of 0 is 1.188 standard errors away from the hypothesized value.

Therefore, considering the $p$-value, confidence interval, and $t$-statistic, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. For a wait time of under 62 minutes, there is no evidence in the data for a relationship between the predictor (`waiting`) and outcome (`duration`) variables.

##### According to the code....

$p$-value

>the p-value for the null hypothesis is 0.036. As 0.05 > $p$ > 0.01, there is moderate evidence against the null hypothesis of $\beta_1$ = 0.

Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$

> the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ does not include $\beta_1$ = 0. As such, there is a 95% confidence that $\beta_1$ does not have a value of 0, which is evidence to reject a null hypothesis of $\beta_1$ = 0.

$t$-statistic

> the t-statistic is 2.127. A moderately sized t-statistic such as this indicates that a $\beta_1$ coefficient of 0 is somewhat far from the hypothesized value.
 
A wait time of under 64 minutes may have a $\beta_1$ coefficient of 0. The $p$-value indicates moderate evidence against the nul hypothesis, while the $t$-statistic presents little evidence to reject it. However, the 95% confidence does not include $\beta_1$ = 0, which means that there is a 95% confidence that this coefficient does not have a value of zero. Therefore, for a wait time of under 62 minutes, there is little evidence in the data for a relationship between the predictor (`waiting`) and outcome (`duration`) variables.

#### Under 66 minutes of wait time


```python
import plotly.express as px
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf


short_wait_limit = 66
short_wait = old_faithful.waiting < short_wait_limit

print(smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[short_wait]).fit().summary().tables[1])

##### According to the code....

$p$-value

>the p-value for the null hypothesis is 0.000. As a result, there is no evidence against the null hypothesis as it is theoretically impossible to exist.

Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$

> the confidence interval for $\beta_1$ does not include $\beta_1$ = 0. As such, there is a 95% confidence that $\beta_1$ does not have a value of 0, which is further evidence to reject a null hypothesis of $\beta_1$ = 0.

$t$-statistic

> the t-statistic is 3.704. A small t-statistic such as this indicates that a $\beta_1$ coefficient of 0 is close to the hypothesized value.

Therefore, considering the $p$-value, confidence interval, and $t$-statistic, we reject the null hypothesis. For a wait time of under 66 minutes, there is strong evidence in the data for a relationship between the predictor (`waiting`) and outcome (`duration`) variables.

#### Conclusion

Overall, as the wait time increases from under 62 minutes to under 66 minutes, the null hypothesis becomes increasingly less likely and the evidence to reject it becomes stronger. This continues until it becomes theoretically impossible (at a wait time of under 66 minutes), due to a $p$-value of 0, a 95% confidence interval which does not include the null hypothesis, and a large $t$-statistic. This reflects well with the full data set, as it also rejects the null hypothesis.

>### Session Summary: Understanding and Interpreting T-statistics in Hypothesis Testing
>
>This session focused on clarifying the meaning and interpretation of t-statistics in the context of hypothesis testing, particularly within the framework of simple linear regression as discussed in the sources. The conversation began with a general overview of t-statistics and their role in measuring the distance between an estimated coefficient and a hypothesized value. It then progressed to understanding specific interpretations of t-statistics and the concept of hypothesized values.
>
>#### Key Insights from the Session:
>
>*   **The T-statistic as a Measure of Distance:** The sources emphasize that the t-statistic quantifies how many standard errors an estimated coefficient, like the slope in simple linear regression, is away from the hypothesized value under the null hypothesis. The session clarified that a **larger t-statistic (in absolute value) suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis**, as it implies a greater discrepancy between the estimated and hypothesized values.
>*   **Standard Error and Uncertainty:** The standard error, a measure of the variability associated with the estimated coefficient, plays a crucial role in the calculation of the t-statistic. A larger standard error leads to a smaller t-statistic, making it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis.
>*   **Interpreting a Specific T-statistic (1.188):** The session addressed the meaning of a t-statistic of 1.188. It was clarified that this value indicates the estimated coefficient is 1.188 standard errors away from the hypothesized value. Without additional context, such as the degrees of freedom or the specific hypothesis test, it's impossible to determine the exact p-value. However, a t-statistic of 1.188 is not particularly large, suggesting the evidence against the null hypothesis might not be strong.
>*   **Hypothesized Values in Null Hypotheses:** While the sources don't explicitly state a particular hypothesized value, they provide a general understanding of how these values are chosen. The session emphasized that **hypothesized values represent specific numerical claims about population parameters**, not sample statistics. These values are often chosen to represent a "no effect" scenario or a default assumption that the researcher aims to challenge.
>*   **Common Examples of Hypothesized Values:** The conversation provided examples of null hypotheses and their associated hypothesized values, including:
    *   **"No Effect" in Treatments:**  $H_0: Î¼ = 0$ (hypothesized value is 0, meaning no average change due to treatment).
    *   **Fairness of a Coin:**  $H_0: p = 0.5$ (hypothesized value is 0.5, representing a fair coin).
    *   **No Linear Association:**  $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ (hypothesized value is 0 for the slope coefficient, implying no linear relationship).
>
>#### Connecting to the Sources:
>
>The session drew heavily upon the sources' emphasis on the **importance of hypothesis testing and p-values in statistical inference**. The sources provide a foundation for understanding the role of t-statistics in hypothesis testing and the connection between t-statistics and p-values. However, they don't offer specific guidance on interpreting particular t-statistic values.
>
>#### Conclusion:
>
>The session clarified the meaning of t-statistics, highlighting their role in measuring the distance between an estimated coefficient and a hypothesized value in terms of standard errors. It emphasized that larger t-statistics suggest stronger evidence against the null hypothesis. The conversation also underscored the importance of understanding hypothesized values as specific numerical claims about population parameters that are tested using sample data. 
>
>**Note:** The sources and our conversation didn't provide a table or specific guidelines for interpreting different t-statistic values. If you need to determine the significance of specific t-statistics, you might need to consult additional resources such as statistical textbooks or online tutorials, remembering to independently verify any information obtained from sources outside those provided.

>
>1. **Simulating and Bootstrapping Regression Slopes**: 
>   - We discussed generating bootstrapped samples and simulating sampling distributions of slope coefficients. This involved creating linear regression models for each bootstrap sample and collecting slope coefficients to analyze the distributions.
>   - Specifically, we worked on creating samples with assumptions for a null hypothesis of no linear association, with parameters \( \beta_0 = 1.65 \), \( \beta_1 = 0 \), and \( \sigma = 0.37 \), using long wait times from the `old_faithful` dataset.
>
>2. **Bootstrapped Confidence Interval**:
>   - We calculated a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval for slope coefficients from the bootstrap distribution, then checked if the interval included zero. This was essential to assess whether there was a significant linear association.
>
>3. **Simulated and Fitted P-Values**:
>   - We reviewed code for simulating the p-value by comparing the simulated slope distribution to the observed slope. This included interpreting whether the p-value from the simulated null distribution matched the one from a fitted model.
>   - We examined differences between using `.summary().tables[1]` and accessing the p-value directly with `.pvalues['waiting']`. We found that `.pvalues` provides a direct and cleaner way to access specific metrics.

### 11.

The "big picture" differences between this model specification and previous ones is that this one relies on either a 'long' or 'short' value for wait times. By comparison, previous models used numerical value for their specifications (such as a wait time of under 62 minutes), or none at all (for the overall old faithful model).

#### Null Hypothesis

$H_0:$ $(k_i)\beta_{contrast}$ = 0


```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

long_wait_limit = 68
long_wait = old_faithful.waiting > long_wait_limit

model = smf.ols('duration ~ waiting', data=old_faithful[long_wait]).fit()

> the confidence interval for $(k_i)\beta_{contrast}$ does not include $(k_i)\beta_{contrast}$ = 0. As such, there is a 95% confidence that $(k_i)\beta_{contrast}$ does not have a value of 0.

$t$-statistic

>In this session, we discussed how to use a linear regression model in Python with `statsmodels` to analyze data and test hypotheses. Specifically, we focused on:
>
>1. **Setting Up a Model for Hypothesis Testing**:
>   - You wanted to test for a difference between groups in the Old Faithful dataset using a binary indicator variable (`long`). We established that the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) was that there is no difference in the dependent variable (`duration`) between groups defined by `long`.
>  
>2. **Model Fitting Using `statsmodels`**:
>   - You used `smf.ols` to fit a linear model in which `duration` was regressed on `long`, an indicator variable.
>   - I provided code to fit the model and output a summary table, focusing on interpreting the coefficient for `long` and its p-value to assess the evidence against the null hypothesis.
>   
>3. **Troubleshooting**:
>   - You encountered an error due to `long` not being defined in your dataset. We discussed how to create the `long` column as an indicator based on a condition in the `waiting` column (e.g., `waiting > 71`).
>   - I corrected the code to ensure `long` was properly added as a column in `old_faithful` before fitting the model.
>
>With these steps, you should be able to run a regression to assess differences between groups and extract relevant summary statistics to interpret the results. Let me know if youâ€™d like further assistance with this or related analyses!
